# Principal Engineer, Information & Insight

**Purpose:**
Ensure the company can move fast and scale safely across **data, information, and insight**, without accumulating hidden operational risk. This role is accountable for the **correctness of data and information**, not for deciding outcomes, so that product, engineering, and leadership can generate insight, make decisions, and iterate quickly with confidence. The role remains hands on where it creates leverage, with the explicit goal of enabling speed rather than constraining it.

---

## What Problems I Solve

* Eliminate ambiguity about “what is correct” by clearly defining authoritative data and information sources and their ownership.
* Prevent early shortcuts in data and insight systems from becoming structural decisions that slow the company down as complexity grows.

---

## What Risks I Reduce

* Reduce correctness and credibility risk by ensuring data and information are explainable, auditable, and reproducible.
* Reduce scaling risk by preventing systems that require increasing manual intervention or institutional knowledge to operate.

---

## How I Multiply the Team

* Make decisions cheaper by ensuring teams can trust shared data instead of repeatedly verifying it.
* Enable teams to move quickly and independently by establishing scalable guardrails rather than centralized approval processes.

---

## How I Create Direct Value (Insight & Leverage)

* Unlock faster, higher quality insight by ensuring data can be safely combined, explored, and reused across teams without rework.
* Enable advanced analytics, automation, and AI by creating reliable foundations where inference and experimentation can happen without risking core correctness.

---

## How I Execute

* Remain hands on where execution meaningfully reduces risk, complexity, or ambiguity in data and information systems.
* Shift away from direct execution once systems, patterns, or automation make ongoing maintenance unnecessary.

---

## What This Role Is Not

* This role does **not** decide which decisions should be made; it ensures the **data and information used to make them are correct, trustworthy, and scalable**.
* This role is **not** a slowing mechanism or approval gate; its purpose is to remove friction, eliminate rework, and make speed sustainable as the company grows.
